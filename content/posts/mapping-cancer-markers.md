## Introduction
For the past 5 years, I have profited from using old smartphones to sell 2FA SMS codes, mobile telemetry data, and by serving ads. In this post, we will explore another way to utilize old hardware: contributing to cancer research through the World Community Grid.

This post is less of a guide and more to bring awareness to the project. If you have an old smartphone in a drawer, consider running the BOINC project on it. I would not recommend using your main phone, or buying a new device for this purpose. This is a great way to deal with e-waste and contribute to a good cause.

## Setup (Android)
1. **Download BOINC**: Install the BOINC app from the [Official Site](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php?platform=android).

2. Once downloaded, open the app and select "Add Project".
3. Search for "World Community Grid" and select it.
4. Login with WCG credentials or create a new account.
5. That's it! The app will automatically download and run tasks in the background. I recommend adjusting the preferences as you see fit.

## Conclusion
It is worth noting that this project can be ran on any device, including desktops and laptops. There are also other projects that can be ran on the same BOINC client. I hope this post shows what is possible with old hardware whether it be for profit or for a good cause.

Thanks for reading!

      <description>Introduction For the past 5 years, I have profited from using old smartphones to sell 2FA SMS codes, mobile telemetry data, and by serving ads. In this post, we will explore another way to utilize old hardware: contributing to cancer research through the World Community Grid.&#xA;This post is less of a guide and more to bring awareness to the project. If you have an old smartphone in a drawer, consider running the BOINC project on it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Exposing services on the internet can be a daunting task. In this post, we will explore how to expose services using Nginx, Ansible, and Cloudflare. We will use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to our services, Ansible to automate the configuration of our server, and Cloudflare to manage our DNS records and provide SSL certificates.&#xA;Pre-requisites Before we begin, you will need the following:&#xA;Domain name. This guide is written with the assumption that you have a domain name registered with Cloudflare, but you can adapt it to work with other DNS providers.</description>

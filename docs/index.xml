      <description>Introduction Exposing services on the internet can be a daunting task. In this post, we will explore how to expose services using Nginx, Ansible, and Cloudflare. We will use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to our services, Ansible to automate the configuration of our server, and Cloudflare to manage our DNS records and provide SSL certificates.&#xA;Pre-requisites Before we begin, you will need the following:&#xA;Domain name. This guide is written with the assumption that you have a domain name registered with Cloudflare, but you can adapt it to work with other DNS providers.</description>

One being the Tailscale container (configured in compose.yaml) and the container we want to set network_mode: &amp;ldquo;service:tailscale&amp;rdquo; as.</description>
